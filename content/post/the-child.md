## :heart: the child :child:

In repose against the flimsy mattress with sputtering coughs and incomprehensible wheezing\
the child yawns and feels his back - reaching for a grasp.\
Will you scratch it?\
Of course, where?\
Up. Up. There.\
Feigning relief and mastering enough courage to fit a smile, a grin, a memory\
on his face\
he feels the skin's imperfections; little bumps, backbone.\
He stops.\
And then runs a finger across, tracing a tree.\
When I was a boy, Pop drew on my back like this.\
What is it?\
Guess.\
A circle?\
No. \
An eight?\
Close.\
Silence and thought and the crackling congestion breaking its way into the still room\
with no where to rest itself.\
The child whispers\
A flower?\
Yes!\
Weariness wins with the fear enough at bay to not prevent either from rest\
Though in fits he'll worry through the night and hell.\
Powerless, unquinch3d. The child dreams and \
Already sounds better, but that doesn't spare the tears.\
