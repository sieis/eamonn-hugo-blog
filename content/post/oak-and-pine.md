## :heart: oak and pine :deciduous_tree:
{{< transistor_podcast_player 9e9196fa >}}
Treading lightly with foot folly between branches strewn about\
on dampened turf in patches here and there in the mostly browned\
trail smeared with mud and leaves and the occasional pile of dog sh*t:\
there the slow trod of steps make barely an impression on the shattered landscape.\
Oak and pine and others lie strewn about - matchsticks splintered and rendered back\
to the earth in no easy way.\
They were torn and they will remain even so in the\
afterthought of that fleeting celebration of\
fire and wind and God.\
The way forward is slow and beautiful and painful. Splinters of the sun cut\
through trees overlooking the water and flashes from the waves blind in rhythm with the trail.\
Pummel down concrete runway into the dark and morbid pre-dawn\
of suburbia still sleeping and creeping inside itself behind shadows within itself.\
A mist hangs in the air, remnants of the night's black storm.\
Down and left and up and left and down and left and up and\
lap upon lap feeds the desire, fills up the fury\
as the body drains.\
A hooded phantom trudges up the sidewalk bent forward into the inevitability of theday ahead,\
the mile ahead and the ones now behind.\
He doesn't look up until I pass at a wide berth.\
Hoping always to prevent the fear of ambush,\
the primitive emotions so near the surface in these moments drawn out and\
stretched to slow the experience, the escape, the truth, the lie.\
With sludging my conscience ebbs within the guttural boundaries laid within the dim\ earth ahead,\
the placid, forgetful road fog covering thought, word and deed.\
Legs reaching onward, ever pulling upward and forward, somewhat wearily in meditation.\
I am a journey riding on the wind of my mistakes and launched into the narrow precipice that encapsulates\
both my blood and my pneuma.\
There are no footfalls in the sky, only breath; there are no regrets without the flickering they inhabit -\
self-fulfilling, self-sustaining miracle of doom.\
The dawn brings new dreams.\
Exhale.
