Hey there! I am a web developer and serial-podcaster. :microphone:

I quite love creating music-centric pieces of art, and founded Undertow Podcasts as a nexus for these ventures in 2019.

I am a web developer as well, and have fallen deeply in love with the Jamstack.

By day I run a [coffee company](https://cupsespressocafe.com), and have developed an insatiable appetite for specialty coffee after nearly two decades in the industry.

Podcasting and web development are both a tinkerer's dreamscape, and I intend to continue using them as muses for my own creative undertow.

I'll be publishing more content out in the open during 2021 in the hopes of growing as a developer, an artist and a person.
